            <h1>For bees</h1>
            <p>Urban gardening plays a crucial role in supporting the declining
                populations of essential pollinators like bees and butterflies. By
                creating green spaces in urban environments, we provide
                much-needed sources of food, shelter, and habitat for these vital
                insects. By cultivating a diverse range of plants, especially
                native species rich in nectar and pollen, urban gardens become
                havens for bees and butterflies to thrive. Through urban gardening
                practices, we not only enhance the beauty of our cities but also
                contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and the
                sustainability of our ecosystems. Join the movement today and be a
                guardian of these essential pollinators through urban gardening.
